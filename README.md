#Visual Programming for BIM#

## Description ##
Dynamo extends the parametric functionality of Autodesk Revit. Dynamo aims to be accessible to both non-programmers and the programmers alike with the ability to visually script behavior, define custom nodes, and script using Python.

Dynamo has been developed based on feedback from several parties including Arup, KPF, Buro Happold, Autodesk, and students and faculty at the USC School of Architecture.


## Running Dynamo ##

The current version will run on top of Autodesk Revit 2013, Autodesk Revit 2014, and Autodesk Project Vasari Beta 3. 

## Releases ##

###0.7.0###
This is an alpha quality release which represents a significant refactoring of the underlying code.  There are some notable (temporary) restricitions to the functionality that is available in 0.6.3, and major enhancements to others. To allow users to continue work with 0.6.3 while exploring 0.7.0, this release can be installed side by side with older releases.  

New

- New geometry tools:  Dynamo now has a much more extensive collection of geometric operations that are available in stand alone mode as well as when running in Revit. 
- New scripting interface:  Dynamo now allows for direct input of DesignScript code into CodeBlock nodes.  Please see this document for learning DesignScript syntax and capabilities: http://designscript.org/manual.pdf  
 
 
Temporarily Unavailable Functionality from 0.6.3 (coming back soon!)

- Upgrade:  0.6 Dynamo files cannot be opened in 0.7.0.  We are actively working on the upgrade mechanism
- Package Manager: currently disabled until migration is working
- Recursion in custom nodes
- Revit Element explosion to geometry.  Currently users cannot generically extract geometric information from Revit elements.  However, there are different tools that, on a per elment basis, can extract geometric data.  For instance, After selecting a curve from Revit, a user can look in Revit>Element>CurveElement>Query>Curve to extract the geometry.  Similarly, a Family Instance can be queried for such items as faces, curves, location, etc.  
- Revit Elements created in a Revit session are not remembered in subsequent sessions.  New elements will be created when files are re-opened.
 
 
Known Problem Areas
- You can only load 0.7.0 or 0.6.3 in a Revit session.  You must close Revit before changing from one to the other.
- Visualization can be slow with lots of curvy stuff
- Manually Deleting and recreating Revit elements created by Dynamo can cause element duplication or failure to be re-created when the graph is re-run,
- Search tags are in progress.  If you don't find what you are looking for via search, try browsing.

## Instrumentation ##
Dynamo now contains an instrumentation system. This anonymously reports usage data to the Dynamo team that will be used to enhance the usability the product. Aggregated summaries of the data will be shared back with the Dynamo community.

An example of the data communicated is:

"DateTime: 2013-08-22 19:17:21, AppIdent: Dynamo, Tag: Heartbeat-Uptime-s, Data: MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=, Priority: Info, SessionID: 3fd39f21-1c3f-4cf3-8cdd-f46ca5dde636, UserID: 2ac95f29-a912-49a8-8fb5-e2d287683d94"

The Data is Base64 encoded. For example, the data field above ('MTMxMjQxLjY3MzAyMDg=') decodes to: '131241.6730208' This represents the number of seconds that the instance of Dynamo has been running. 

The UserID is randomly generated when the application is first run. The SessionID is randomly generated each time Dynamo is opened.
